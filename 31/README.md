# Project 31: The What & How in data management: Improving connectivity between RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook

## Abstract

This project aims to enhance the interoperability between the RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook. We will start by identifying gaps in the connection between the two resources, then build on previous technical linking solutions to implement lightweight, sustainable linking mechanisms. We will define and implement a combination of technical and operational procedures to ensure linking between the two resources evolves correctly with the addition, removal and updating of content, while keeping human involvement as minimal as possible.
Where appropriate, we will also work on the content of the two resources in order to foster greater interoperability. We aim to identify areas of need in the two resources through both the aforementioned gap analysis and through exploratory user feedback at the Biohackathon. Based on this feedback, we will then implement an action plan to recruit targeted contributions to fill gaps and improve the interoperability between the resources without duplicating efforts.

## Topics

Data Platform, Interoperability Platform, Tools Platform, Training Platform

**Project Number:** 31

### Lead(s)

Rafael Andrade Buono - rafael.buono@psb.ugent.be (Primary lead)
Danielle Welter - danielle.welter@uni.lu

## Expected outcomes

At the end of the BioHackathon:
- A gap analysis of the connections of the two resources, including identification of content gaps where connections could be beneficial
- An improvement on the connections, with addition of mechanisms (technical and operational) to help editors identify and deal with:
  - Broken links in content and connected resources
  - Highlighting of content that might be going stale or getting outdated, and require review
  - Flagging of content that has been heavily edited by a connected resource, thus potentially requiring addition or removal of links

After the BioHackathon (6 months):
- New content based on identified gaps and contributors
- Enhanced interoperability between RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook with more and better links
- Implementation of maintenance tasks in both resources triggering actions from the editorial teams in support of long term sustainability

## Expected audience

 Members of the editorial teams of RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook  
 People with knowledge on RDMkit and FAIR Cookbook  
 People with general interest in research data management and FAIR practices  

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
