# Project 3: Bioinforming

## Abstract

The project consists in designing a five-day training school in Bioinformatics, tailored to each of three different target groups of young students. Additionally, a practical example of a real training school will be presented as a use case.

The envisaged training schools will be designed as five-day-long introductory courses in Bioinformatics, with a focus on protein sequence and structure. We identified three target groups that will have a dedicated training school according to their background: 1) high school students; 2) undergraduate students in Biology or related degrees; 3) bachelor students in Computer Science. During the biohackathon, we will determine the learning goals and learning objectives of each specific target group. Moreover, we will highlight what an ideal program should contain and we will define the associated activity and assessment plans. An ideal training school should present overviews of Erasmus+ mobility opportunities and FAIR principles (especially for undergraduate students), but also raise awareness of biodiversity loss and gender inequality in science.

The ELIXIR Training Platform will be used as a material source for the training schools' content creation. We also aim to actively contribute to the expansion of the platform during the biohackathon and afterwards. In particular, we will generate open-source and FAIRifyed teaching content and materials.

The authors of this proposal founded NGO 'Bioinformatika', which offers freely-available training schools in Bioinformatics to young students. The NGO aims to compensate for the fact that Bioinformatics is only rarely integrated into high school teaching programs and to play an active role in preparing the next generation of bioinformaticians. We operated mostly in Montenegro and with high school students. We consider the Elixir Biohackathon as an opportunity to expand the format in Europe, improve the contents of the training schools and increase our collaboration network with other researchers involved in training and education.

## Expected outcomes

- Creation of three teaching plans in terms of learning goals and learning objectives for introductory training schools in Bioinformatics. The target groups will be: 1) high school students; 2) undergraduate students in Biology or related degrees; 3) bachelor students in Computer Science. Timeframe: 2 hacking days

- Preparation of a five-day training school course content that will be open-source and FAIRifyed. The training school preparation will be chosen among the three target groups. Timeframe: 2 hacking days

- Preparation of five-day course content for the remaining two training schools. Materials will be open-source and FAIRifyed. The material will be available through the Elixir training platform. Timeframe: 3 months after the biohackathon.

- Writing a bioinformatics training school handbook for the chosen use case which will be available on BioHackrXiv. Timeframe: 2 months after the biohackathon

## Expected audience

- Researchers with an interest in training and education.
- Researchers with Bioinformatics background.
- Researchers with Biology-related backgrounds.
- Researchers with Computer Science background.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
