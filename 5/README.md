# Project 5: Bioschemas - Enabling profile updates through the Data Discovery Engine (DDE)

## Abstract

Bioschemas is a grassroots community effort to improve FAIRness of resources in the Life sciences by defining specific Life Science metadata schemas and exposing that metadata from resources that have adopted it. Now that some initial types have been adopted directly into schema.org, an improved mechanism is required to reignite community engagement and encourage profile development. The current process for creating or updating Bioschemas profiles and types is technical and convoluted which creates accessibility issues that can hamper community participation. As adoption of Bioschemas grows and more of the Life Science community considers contributing specific types and profiles, a more accessible creation/modification process is necessary to avoid a loss in engagement. To drive further Bioschemas adoption the community have adopted the Data Discovery Engine (DDE) for profile and type development. DDE provides a schema registry and user-friendly tools for creating and editing schemas. The goal of this project is to update existing Bioschemas community profiles in a targeted and crowd-sourced manner, add new profiles as required, and to ensure the documentation is fit for purpose to enable Bioschemas contributions at scale.

## Topics

Bioschemas
Data Platform
Interoperability Platform

**Project Number:** 5

### Lead(s)

Nick Juty : nsjuty@gmail.com

## Expected outcomes

1. Refinement/creation of documentation and tutorials on creating/updating Bioschemas Profiles using DDE.
2. Updating a number of Bioschemas profiles through a group hackathon exercise
3. Invite targeted participants to work on new profiles
4. Invite ELIXIR CRDs and DDRs to improve deployment across the e-infrastructure
- timeframe - mostly during and immediately after the BH

## Expected audience

We will target and invite representatives from a number of groups to a) update existing profiles, and b) to create new types that are ready to go. 
This will be reps from existing resources and from identified communities (some of whom will already be creating profiles or types)

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4

### Potential tasks
* Add `sameAs` for all profiles: https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/issues/567
* JSON-LD representations of specifications were generated based on yaml files from the Manchesterâ€™s Bioschemas Validator repository. There were a number of specifications for which the yaml files were missing--as such, there is no JSON-LD representation for these specifications. List of missing here: https://github.com/gtsueng/bioschemas_yml_to_dde_json/blob/main/results/missing_jsonld.tsv
