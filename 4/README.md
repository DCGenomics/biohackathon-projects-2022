# Project 4: BioHackrXiv

## Abstract

BioHackrXiv allows publishing papers for biohackathons and codefests. This includes this Elixir biohackathon and the upcoming 48 hour pangenomics hackathon in 2022. This year we will expand on the metadata representation, add functionality to the PDF preview generator and add IPFS support for publication - that adds to the DOI system. We should also look at tying datasets and source code to the publications using IPFS or other permanent URIs. These can be integrated using a workflow definition (2022 is the year of the workflows!)

This year it would be an improvement to start reporting on day 1 of the Elixir biohackathon for every project in a markdown document that can be used for the reporting sessions half-way and at the end of the biohackathon. In fact, if we encourage this from the start the publications should be ready for publishing at the end of the week.
