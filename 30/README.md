# Project 30: The ELIXIR::GA4GH Cloud - Admin and User Engagement

## Abstract

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), an international standard-setting organization bringing together opinion leaders in academia and industry, has proposed a set of community standards for data storage, transfer and processing in the cloud. The ELIXIR Cloud & AAI community, a GA4GH Driver Project, is developing the ELIXIR::GA4GH Cloud (EGC), a federated cloud environment for large-scale data analysis in the life sciences. Interoperability across services and clouds is achieved through adopting GA4GH standards and authentication and authorization guidelines.

We have recently set up a service registry as an entry point into the EGC. Registered services have been tested for interoperability with one another and are deployed across various ELIXIR nodes. They can be used by our driver projects and other interested parties to run data analysis workflows of various types (e.g., CWL, Nextflow, Snakemake). The main goals of the hackathon project are to engage additional drivers/testers, systems/service administrators and service developers in the ELIXIR community to work on use cases, expansion of the EGC and further adoption of standards.

**Project Number:** 30

### Lead(s)

Alex Kanitz <alexander.kanitz@unibas.ch>

## Expected outcomes

Possible outcomes include:
- New driver projects found and/or use cases for the EGC defined
- Additional computing centers and data portals represented by the BioHackathon - community integrated into the EGC
- New services integrated into the EGC
- Improved deployment documentation and automation (e.g., CI/CD)

## Expected audience

- Bioinformaticians / data scientists, particularly those needing to run different workflows on large amounts of data
- Systems/service administrators / DevOps, particularly those interested in having their nodes join the EGC
- Developers, particularly those interested in adopting standards and guidelines to make their services compatible with the EGC

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
