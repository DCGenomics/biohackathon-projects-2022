# Project 11: Enhancement and Reusage of Biomedical Knowledge Graph Subsets

## Abstract

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as Wikidata act as a hub of information from multiple domains and disciplines, and is crowdsourced by multiple stakeholders. The vast amount of available information makes it difficult for researchers to manage the entire KG, which is also continually being edited and changing its content. It is necessary to develop tools that extract snapshots and subsets for some specific domains of interest. These subsets help researchers by reducing costs and ease accessbility to data of interest. In the last two biohackathons, we have identified this issue and created prototypes to extract subsets easily applicable to Wikidata, as well as to define a map of the different approaches used to tackle this problem. Building on those outcomes, we aim to enhance subsetting in both definitions using Entity schemas based on Shape Expressions and extraction algorithms, with a special focus on the biomedical domain captured by entity schemas like the one defined in the GeneWiki project. Our first aim is to develop complex subsetting patterns to cover subsetting based on qualifiers and references for enhancing credibility of datasets. Our second aim is to establish a faster subsetting extraction platform applying new algorithms based on Apache Spark and new tools like a document-oriented DBMS platform. During this biohackathon, we aim to explore reuse workflows of Wikidata subsets specifically with respect to drug repurposing. The biohackathon will assist in an evaluation of existing nodes and edges on drug-target interactions categories within Wikidata, and if these are in need of updates as well as deeper annotation. We would also aim to deliver machine readable schemas of drug-target interactions in Wikidata for future data reuse.

## Expected outcomes

1- Subsetting based on complex patterns, i.e., having complicated definitions to delicately define the boundaries of the subset.
2- Subsetting based on contextual metadata, e.g., considering references/qualifiers in Wikidata
3- Creation of biomedical subsets of Wikidata based on complex schemas like the ones defined in the GeneWiki project 
4- Deployment, Enrichment and transformation techniques and tools for the subsets created
5 - Improved biomedical schemas in Wikidata 
6 - Enhanced annotation of biomedical nodes and edges

## Expected audience

Biomedical domain experts
Data modelers with interest in Wikidata and knowledge graphs
Developers with Python/Java/Javascript/Scala skills
Data engineers with Knowledge on Spark and parallelization algorithms
